## Introduction

### Brief

With Pokémon October, you are a trainer in the **Kansai region**, based off of the October/November 1998 beta maps found in the Pokémon Gold and Silver source code. Prepare to traverse Generation II as you've never seen it before, featuring an extended plot, increased prominence of both old Pokémon as well as new ones, new and beta music, a fixed level curve, beta cries, and other features.  
  
Do note that this hack is made using the **MBC30 mapper**, which is found only in the Japanese Pokémon Crystal. This increases the ROM size to 4MB instead of the typical 2MB, and as such is only supported by more modern emulators, such as mGBA, BGB, and SameBoy. See the chart in the GitHub repo for a full list of compatible emulators. **However, this also has allowed for more features, including following Pokémon, smoother animated sprites, and the Orange Islands as an upcoming postgame area in addition to Kanto!** It can be played on an emulator that does not support MBC30, but animations and following Pokemon will be disabled. However, everything else will function normally, and the demo is playable from start to finish, up to Route 33, shortly after Morty (the 4th Gym). **A patch file, not the ROM itself, will be provided for download in the thread.**Patch this to a Pokémon Crystal ROM using the popular Lunar IPS, or the online MarcoBledo ROM Patcherjs, or any other ips patching tools that you may have at your disposal.  

### How to Patch

The current version is Demo 1. The ROM to be patched is Pokémon - Crystal Version (UE) (V1.1) \[C\]\[!\] with the MD5 sum of `301899B8087289A6436B0A241FBBB474`.  
  
If you downloaded the previous version, the newest releases features 16-bit item indexing, which unfortunately means that you will need to start over from the beginning. However, it is well worth it, considering that many reported unavoidable crashes have been fixed, as well as tweaks and other minor additions.
